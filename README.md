# SOKOBAN
The goal of this project is to represent th game Sokoban, who was created in japon.
We had two weeks to realise it.

# RULES
The player is represented by "P" and can move horizontally or vertically onto empty squares, never through walls or boxes "#". The player can also move into a box, which pushes it into the square beyond. Boxes may not be pushed into other boxes or walls, and they can not be pulled. The number of boxes is equal to the number of storage locations. The puzzle is solved when all the boxes are at storage locations.
